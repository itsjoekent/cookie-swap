            <h3>What is the World's Largest Cookie Swap?</h3>
            <p>
              Cookies are better when shared with new friends. We're a friend group who loves chocolate chip cookies and are excited to try new recipes and meet other cookie enthusiasts - all while raising awareness for organizations combating food insecurity in NYC.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arrive with 1-2 dozen cookies, as well as an additional tupperware. Leave with a wide variety of flavors and new friends.

            <h3>When and where?</h3>
            <p>
              Mark your calendars: May 11th at 2pm. The location is Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn, NY, just north of the tennis courts.

            <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
            <p>
              We're a group of friends excited by odd themed parties, new friends, and tasty cookies. Furthermore, food insecurity is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/nyregion/nyc-poverty.html">on the rise</a> in New York City and we are eager to support City Harvest, a stellar organization providing support for communities in need. We'd encourage you to donate to City Harvest via our Instagram fundraiser (so we can track donations!)
